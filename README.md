# 🎮 Game Glitch Investigator: The Impossible Guesser

## 🚨 The Situation

You asked an AI to build a simple "Number Guessing Game" using Streamlit.
It wrote the code, ran away, and now the game is unplayable. 

- You can't win.
- The hints lie to you.
- The secret number seems to have commitment issues.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the broken app: `python -m streamlit run app.py`

## 🕵️‍♂️ Your Mission

1. **Play the game.** Open the "Developer Debug Info" tab in the app to see the secret number. Try to win.
2. **Find the State Bug.** Why does the secret number change every time you click "Submit"? Ask ChatGPT: *"How do I keep a variable from resetting in Streamlit when I click a button?"*
3. **Fix the Logic.** The hints ("Higher/Lower") are wrong. Fix them.
4. **Refactor & Test.** - Move the logic into `logic_utils.py`.
   - Run `pytest` in your terminal.
   - Keep fixing until all tests pass!

## Document Your Experience

This project taught me how subtle bugs in AI-generated code can completely break 
a game's logic. The hardest bug to catch was the string vs integer comparison — 
the game looked like it was working but was giving wrong hints every other guess.

I used Claude to help identify bugs, write fixes, and generate pytest tests. 
I learned that AI suggestions need to be verified — Claude swapped the hint 
messages at one point and I had to catch it by reading the error output carefully.

## Demo Walkthrough
1. User selects "Normal" difficulty (range: 1–100, 8 attempts)
2. User enters a guess of 40 → game returns "Go HIGHER!"
3. User enters a guess of 70 → game returns "Go LOWER!"
4. Score decreases by 5 after each wrong guess
5. User enters a guess of 55 → game returns "Go HIGHER!"
6. User enters a guess of 63 → game returns "Correct!" 🎉
7. Final score displays and balloons appear
8. User clicks "New Game" to reset and play again
